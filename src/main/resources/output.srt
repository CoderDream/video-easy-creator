1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
順便說一下，別忘了帶手電筒。森林裏晚上會非常黑。

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:11,980
By the way, don't forget to bring a flashlight. It gets really dark in the forest at night.

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,929
明白了。那驅蟲劑呢？有很多蟲子嗎？

4
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:22,670
Got it. What about bug spray? Are there a lot of insects?

5
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:27,980
是的，最好帶上一些。可能會有蚊子和其他蟲子。

6
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:33,679
Yeah, it's better to have some. There might be mosquitoes and other bugs.

7
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,920
好的，我會帶上。那裏有手機信號嗎？

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,660
Okay, I'll pack it. Will we have cell phone signal there?

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,820
信號可能很弱。所以這是一個遠離科技的好機會。

10
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,550
The signal might be weak. So it's a good chance to disconnect from technology.

11
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,000
沒錯。我很期待晚上看星星。

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,280
That's true. I'm excited to stargaze at night.

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,390
我也是。那裏的天空非常清澈。我們可以看到很多星座。

14
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:14,280
Me too. The sky there is really clear. We can see a lot of constellations.

15
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,360
聽起來很棒。我們應該帶相機去捕捉美好瞬間嗎？

16
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,710
Sounds amazing. Should we bring a camera to capture the beautiful moments?

17
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:29,390
當然。如果不記錄下這麽棒的經歷就太可惜了。

18
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:34,880
Definitely. It would be a pity not to record such a great experience.

19
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,330
好的，我一定會帶上。期待我們的露營之旅！

20
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:44,680
Alright, I'll make sure to bring it. Looking forward to our camping trip!
